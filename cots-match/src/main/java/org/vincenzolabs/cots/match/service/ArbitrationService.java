    // approaching time limit.

    // FIXME
    // If no challenge is made after 30 complete moves from the start of the game, the player with more pieces
    // past the mid-point of the board wins the match. If no piece has gone beyond the mid-point, or if there is an
    // equal number of pieces beyond the mid-point, the game is automatically declared a draw.

    // FIXME back and forth
    // A 5-move perpetual position results in a  drawn game. This happens when an attacked piece, which faces
    // immediate challenge, move 5 consecutive move by the same attacking piece.

    // FIXME all over the board
    // A player position results in a drawn game. This happens when an attacked piece, which faces immediate challenge,
    // moves 16 consecutive times through more than 2 squares in order to avoid being challenged on the next, move by
    // the same attacking piece.
